# myRA-CM-optical
This is my RA project from Dr. Boecherer. Applying coded modulation on iterative demapping and turbo decoding optical communication system.

This is the first time using GitHub on my Matlab Project. This version now basicly realize the structure of communication system. 
But the results of simulation clearly showed that the decoder or demapper was wrong.

According to the suggestion of Dr. Boecherer, I will reveal the line of with no coded modulation to check the 
turbo decoder is correct or not.
